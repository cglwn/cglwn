* TODO An interactive demo visualization for Gaussian Processes
Could start it as just a static matplotlib graph.
Maybe extend it to a matplotlib animation by saving static frames to a folder.
Stretch goal once we get back on the JavaScript bandwagon is to make it work on the web.
* TODO C++ SQLite RAII wrapper
Would be nice to apply the RAII stuff from Discovering Modern C++.
Might have to do this for work if I end up going the SQL route.
* TODO Refactor my ME597 labs
